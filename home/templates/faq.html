                        <div class="panel">
                        <p>SMP is a non-invasive, semi-permanent tattooing technique that replicates the appearance of hair follicles on the scalp.
                            It is suitable for covering thinning areas, bald spots, and creating a fuller hairline.
                            <div class="text-center">

                        <div class="panel">
                        <p>SMP typically lasts 2 to 5 years before requiring a touch-up. Proper aftercare and UV protection can help extend its longevity.</p>
                        </div>
                        <button class="accordion">Does SMP look real?</button>
                        <div class="panel">
                            <p>Yes! When done by an experienced SMP artist, the results mimic natural hair follicles, creating a seamless and natural appearance.</p>
                        </div>
                        <button class="accordion">Is SMP painful?</button>
                        <div class="panel">
                            <p>Most clients describe SMP as mild discomfort rather than pain. The sensation is similar to getting a light tattoo, and numbing agents can be used to minimize discomfort.</p>

                        <button class="accordion">What are the side effects of SMP?</button>
                        <div class="panel">
                            <p>SMP has minimal side effects, but some clients experience temporary redness or minor swelling that subsides within a few days.</p>
                        </div>
                        <button class="accordion">Can SMP be removed?</button>
                        <div class="panel">
                            <p>Yes, SMP can be removed with laser tattoo removal or saline removal methods, though most people opt for touch-ups instead of full removal.</p>
                        </div>
                        <button class="accordion">Is SMP suitable for all hair types and skin tones?</button>
                        <div class="panel">
                            <p>Absolutely! SMP is customized to match different skin tones and hair follicle shades to ensure a natural appearance.</p>

                        <button class="accordion">How much does SMP cost?</button>
                        <div class="panel">
                            <p>The cost varies based on coverage area and clinic location. Prices typically range from $1,000 to $6,000 depending on the treatment size.</p>

                        <button class="accordion">When can I wash my scalp after SMP?</button>
                        <div class="panel">
                            <p>You should wait at least 1-4 days before washing your scalp. After that, use a gentle cleanser and avoid scrubbing.</p>

                        <button class="accordion">Will SMP fade over time?</button>
                        <div class="panel">
                            <p>Yes, SMP naturally fades over several years. However, regular touch-ups can maintain its fresh appearance.</p>

                        <button class="accordion">How to Maintain SMP for a Longer Duration?</button>
                        <div class="panel">
                            <p>1. Use Sunscreen – UV rays can cause pigment fading. Always apply SPF 30+ on your scalp. <br/>
                                2. Moisturize Regularly – Keeping your scalp hydrated prevents excessive dryness and pigment loss.<br/>
                                3. Avoid Harsh Skincare Products – Exfoliating or using strong acids can lead to premature fading.</p>
