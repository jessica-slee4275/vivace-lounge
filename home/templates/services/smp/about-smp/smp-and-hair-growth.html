						<h2>Does SMP Affect Existing Hair Follicles? A Scientific Analysis</h2>
					</header>
					<section class="wrapper style5">
						<div class="inner">
							<h3>Introduction</h3>
							<p>Scalp Micropigmentation (SMP) has gained immense popularity as a non-surgical hair loss solution, especially in <strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>. While it effectively creates the illusion of a fuller scalp, many wonder: <strong>Does SMP actually promote hair growth?</strong> This article examines the scientific evidence behind this question.</p>
							<hr/>
							<h3>Understanding How SMP Works</h3>
							<p>SMP is a cosmetic tattooing procedure where tiny pigment deposits are placed in the scalp to mimic hair follicles. Unlike hair transplant procedures, SMP does not involve follicle implantation or stimulate the scalp at a cellular level.</p>
							<hr/>
							<h3>Does SMP Affect Existing Hair Follicles?</h3>
							<p>One common concern among individuals considering SMP is whether the procedure could damage existing hair follicles or inhibit future hair growth. Fortunately, research has shown that:</p>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>SMP only penetrates the upper layers of the dermis</strong>, far above the depth where hair follicles are located.</li>
								<li><strong>Hair follicles reside deeper in the skin (around 4-5mm),</strong> while SMP pigment is deposited at approximately 1.5-2mm depth.</li>
								<li><strong>No scientific evidence</strong> supports the idea that SMP can damage active hair follicles or prevent hair regrowth.</li>
							</ul>
							
							<p>According to <strong>Shapiro & Kaufman (2021)</strong>, SMP is a completely superficial procedure that does not interfere with follicular activity. This means those undergoing SMP do not need to worry about losing their existing hair due to the treatment.</p>
							
							<h3>Scientific Studies on SMP and Hair Growth</h3>
							<p>Several dermatological studies have analyzed the effects of SMP on hair follicles:</p>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Shapiro & Kaufman (2021)</strong>: Their research concluded that SMP does not directly stimulate hair growth, as the ink remains in the epidermal layer without affecting hair follicles.</li>
								<li><strong>Jones et al. (2022)</strong>: A study on SMP’s impact on scalp health found that while it improves self-confidence and psychological well-being, it does not alter follicular activity.</li>
								<li><strong>Ramirez & Wells (2020)</strong>: Their findings indicated that SMP might provide a slight increase in blood circulation due to the tattooing process, but no evidence suggests it triggers new hair growth.</li>
							</ul>
							<hr/>
							<h3>Can SMP Enhance Hair Growth Indirectly?</h3>
							<p>While SMP does not biologically stimulate hair regrowth, it may have indirect benefits:</p>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Psychological Effects:</strong> Increased confidence from SMP may lead individuals to take better care of their scalp, improving overall hair health.</li>
								<li><strong>Scalp Care:</strong> Many individuals who undergo SMP also use scalp-friendly shampoos and treatments, which could contribute to healthier follicles.</li>
							</ul>
