							<h3>What is Scalp Micropigmentation?</h3>
							<p>Are you struggling with hair loss, thinning hair, or bald spots? <strong>Scalp Micropigmentation (SMP)</strong> is a revolutionary, non-surgical hair restoration technique that creates the appearance of fuller hair through specialized pigmentation. This treatment is ideal for both men and women seeking a permanent, low-maintenance solution to hair loss.</p>

                            <h3>How Does SMP Work?</h3>
                            <p>During an SMP session, skilled technicians use micro-needles to deposit pigment into the scalp, replicating the look of natural hair follicles. The result? A realistic shaved-head effect or the illusion of thicker hair in thinning areas.</p>

                            <p>Unlike hair transplants or temporary treatments, SMP is designed to last 3-7 years with proper care. Over time, minor touch-ups may be required to maintain the pigment’s vibrancy.</p>
